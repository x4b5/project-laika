## Introduction to Prompt Engineering
Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting the text you input into a language model (like ChatGPT) to guide it toward the output you want. In simple terms, a **prompt** is any text you provide to initiate a response – it could be a question, instruction, or conversation starter. Because ChatGPT is a *large language model* trained on vast amounts of text, how you phrase your prompt can dramatically affect the quality and relevance of the answer you get. Prompt engineering has become an important skill for effectively using AI tools, essentially forming a **“communication protocol”** between the human and the model. 

In the context of ChatGPT (a text-based AI), prompt engineering means designing clear, detailed inputs that the model can understand and act on. Unlike traditional programming where you write code, with ChatGPT you “program” it by **describing what you need in natural language**. This guide introduces key concepts, best practices, pitfalls to avoid, and practical examples for users at all levels – from beginners to developers.

## Key Concepts and Terminology
* **Large Language Model (LLM):** A deep learning model trained on massive amounts of text data to understand and generate human‑like language. ChatGPT is an example of an LLM that can carry a conversation, answer questions, write code, etc., based on the prompts it’s given.  
* **Prompt:** The input text or instruction you give to the model to initiate a response.  
* **Prompt Engineering:** The process of designing, refining, and optimizing prompts to guide the model’s output effectively.  
* **Zero‑Shot Prompting:** Asking the model to perform a task *without* providing any examples in the prompt.  
* **Few‑Shot Prompting:** Providing a few **examples** or demonstrations in your prompt before asking the model to perform the actual task.  
* **Chain‑of‑Thought Prompting:** A technique where you prompt the model to produce its reasoning or thought process step‑by‑step before giving a final answer.  
* **Role (Persona) Prompting:** Instructing the model to take on a specific role or voice.  
* **Context Window (Conversation History):** The portion of prior interaction the model can “remember”; limited by a token cap.  
* **Tokens:** Units of text (pieces of words) the model processes; input and output are measured in tokens.  
* **Temperature:** A parameter that controls the randomness or creativity of the model’s output.  
* **Hallucination:** When the AI confidently generates false or ungrounded information.  
* **Iteration:** The process of refining your prompt based on the output you get.  
* **System / User / Assistant Messages:** Roles in the ChatGPT API for structuring conversations.

## Best Practices for Effective Prompts
1. **Be Clear and Specific:** State exactly what you want, including style, format, or detail level.  
2. **Provide Context or Background:** Supply relevant situational details.  
3. **Put Instructions First & Use Delimiters:** Front‑load the ask and separate large blocks of text with ``` or """.  
4. **Specify the Desired Output Format:** Tell the AI if you want a table, JSON, bullet list, etc.  
5. **Give Examples (Few‑Shot):** Show one or two examples if the task is complex.  
6. **Use Step‑by‑Step Instructions:** Break down multi‑part tasks or ask the model to “think step by step.”  
7. **Assign a Role or Perspective:** Frame responses by giving the AI a persona.  
8. **Prefer Positive Instructions:** Tell the model what *to do*, not just what *not* to do.  
9. **Avoid Overloading the Prompt:** Tackle one main objective at a time or separate into stages.  
10. **Iterate and Refine:** Use follow‑ups to clarify or adjust.  
11. **Mind Limitations:** Verify critical facts; know the model’s knowledge cutoff and inability to access real‑time data.

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them
| Pitfall | Why It’s a Problem | How to Avoid |
| ------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| Vague prompts → generic answers | The model guesses context | Add specifics on scope, audience, format |
| Overly complex prompts | Task overload can confuse the model | Break tasks into steps or separate prompts |
| Missing audience/context | Tone or depth mismatch | State who the answer is for & why |
| Negatively‑worded instructions | Model may ignore or misinterpret | Reframe into positive directives |
| Unanswerable questions | AI hallucinates or refuses | Ask for analysis, not predictions; provide data |
| Imprecise length/detail | “Brief” means different things | Quantify: “~100 words” or “3 bullet points” |
| Blind trust of output | AI can hallucinate | Review, verify, and iterate |

## Prompt Engineering Cheatsheet (Quick Reference)
> **Checklist:**  
> ▢ Define a clear role/persona  
> ▢ Provide context & goal  
> ▢ Include examples if needed  
> ▢ Specify tone/style  
> ▢ Define format & length  
> ▢ Use delimiters for clarity  
> ▢ One task per prompt (ideally)  
> ▢ Iterate if unsatisfied  
> ▢ Be literal with keywords  
> ▢ Remember model limitations  

## Use Cases with Practical Examples
### Code Generation
* **Prompt Pattern:**  
  ```text
  You are a helpful coding assistant.  
  Task: Write a **Python** function `is_prime(n)` that returns True if n is prime, False otherwise.  
  Requirements: No external libraries; include comments explaining each step.  
  ```  
* **Tip:** End prompt with a language keyword (`import` for Python) to nudge code output.  
* **Review & Test:** Always run generated code; iterate with error messages.

### Code Analysis and Debugging
* **Prompt Pattern:**  
  ```text
  Act as a code reviewer.  
  Here is a JavaScript function (inside ```javascript ... ```): find the bug and suggest a fix.  
  Also explain why the bug occurs.  
  ```  
* Paste code in fenced block.  
* Provide observed vs expected output for clarity.

### Presentation Writing
* **Prompt Pattern:**  
  ```text
  Audience: non‑technical staff.  
  Topic: data security best practices.  
  Outline a 5‑section presentation (intro, 3 main points, conclusion) with 3 key bullet points per section.  
  Tone: encouraging and accessible.  
  ```  
* Follow up to elaborate bullet points or create speaker notes.

### Communication Enhancement
* **Proofread:**  
  ```text
  Proofread the following paragraph for grammar and clarity:  
  "I can provides the result tomorrow, let me knows if that works."  
  ```  
* **Tone Shift:**  
  ```text
  Rewrite the email below in a polite, professional tone, keeping it under 120 words:  
  [email text]  
  ```  
* **Simplify:**  
  ```text
  Simplify the next passage for a 6th‑grade reading level:  
  [passage]  
  ```
